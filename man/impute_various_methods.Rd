\usage{
impute_various_methods(
  x,
  method = NULL,
  k = 5,
  missing_thres = 0.2,
  group.info = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input data frame for imputation, sample x feature.}

\item{method}{Method for imputation, available methods: HF, half minimum; LoD,
limit of detection, 1/5 of minimum; min, minimum; median; mean;
knn, k nearest neighbor. If knn is chosen, then the number of
nearest neighbors k, missing threshold missing_thres and group.info
(optional) are used. group.info (optional) is a vector indicating
the group information of the samples. knn works in the way that
only the feature with missing rate <= missing_thres in a group
are be imputed with knn group-wise. The rest are imputed with LoD.}

\item{k}{The number of nearest neighbors.}

\item{missing_thres}{Missing threshold for deciding if knn is applied.}

\item{group.info}{Optional, if provides, knn is applied group-wise.}
}
\value{
Imputed data frame.
}
\description{
Missing imputation with various methods.
